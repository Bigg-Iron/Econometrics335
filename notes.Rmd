## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)

# generate the vector of probabilities 
probability <- rep(1/6, 6) 

# plot the probabilities 
plot(probability,
     xlab = "outcomes",
     main = "Probability Distribution")

# generate the vector of cumulative probabilities 
cum_probability <- cumsum(probability) 

# plot the probabilities 
plot(cum_probability, 
     xlab = "outcomes", 
     main = "Cumulative Probability Distribution")
     

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
