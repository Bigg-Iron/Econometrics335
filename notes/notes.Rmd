## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)

# generate the vector of probabilities
probability <- rep(1 / 6, 6)

# plot the probabilities
plot(probability,
     xlab = "outcomes",
     main = "Probability Distribution"
)

# generate the vector of cumulative probabilities
cum_probability <- cumsum(probability)

# plot the probabilities
plot(cum_probability,
     xlab = "outcomes",
     main = "Cumulative Probability Distribution"
)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

### Operators
```{r}
mass <- 47.5
age <- 122
mass <- mass * 2.0
age <- age - 20
mass_index <- mass / age
```


## Math inside R Markdown

#### Mean = $$\bar{X} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i}}{n}$$

#### Variance = $$s^{2} = \frac{SS}{N - 1} = \frac{\sum (x_{i} - \bar{x})^{2}}{N - 1}$$

#### Standard Deviation = $$s = \sqrt{s^{2}} = \sqrt{\frac{SS}{N - 1}} = \sqrt{\frac{\sum (x_{i} - \bar{x})^{2}}{N - 1}}$$

#### Standard Error of the Mean = $$\sigma_{\bar{X}} = \frac{s}{\sqrt{N}}$$
