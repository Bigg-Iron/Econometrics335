# Instructor Thoughts/Notes on Projects

## Some things to think about as you work on your regression studies:

In this class, we have devoted time and attention to both statistical significance and economic significance.  Note that we could have a precisely estimated small effect that is very statistically significant but not very economically significant (if the magnitude is estimated to be something that is not very important for policy for example).  

I have posted a supplemental reading on Canvas which corresponds to a chapter on how to write a regression study which appeared in an earlier version of your class textbook.  Given that the authors are the same, it should be easy to read/follow!  Take a look if you are getting stuck.

When choosing your question, try to pick something of personal interest.  It will be more meaningful to for example discuss in a job situation/interview later if it was something important to you.  Make sure to pick a specific X and a specific Y to focus on even though you will have other variables in there.  Recall that we focused on STR as an X and TESTSCORE as a Y even when we had other X variables in our regressions in the main book exercise.  At this point in the term while it would be nice to briefly look at existing studies to understand what has already done and while it would be nice to match data to your question of interest, it is understood that the opposite might happen.  You might need to adapt your question of interest to available data!  That's ok for our class.  You are welcome to use the Coffee Shop discussion board to pose questions to others about the project and to discuss anything that is coming up.  

There are several data sources noted in the Yale Library link on Canvas but that is not representative of all possible data.  You can use the web or our electronic library materials through CSU to find data in lots of different places.  

Make sure to follow the directions in the problem set project instructions for the first and second submissions.  You will visualize your data (scatterplots, look back at problem set 1 if you have forgotten how to do this) and will be running some econometric models (base specifications and comparisons where you try to do better).  Make sure to format RSudio output into nice, readable tables.  Let me know if and when questions arise.  

And finally, try to have fun with this project!  Again think of it as an investment in your understanding and completion of this course!  I look forward to reading each of them!

Lackson.
